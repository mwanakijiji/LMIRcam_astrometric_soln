A FITS frame of sources (which can be centroided like PSFs) with patterned, known locations. This could be
a pinhole grid, like this:

.. _pinhole_ex:

.. figure:: images/pinholeGridFull.jpeg
	   :scale: 20 %
           :align: center

The idea
**********

We want to find the polynomial coefficients that map between empirical pinhole locations and an idealized grid. We use a direct transliteration of IDL's \texttt{polywarp} procedure, which finds the coefficients :math:`K_{x}^{(i,j)}` and :math:`K_{y}^{(i,j)}` in the following polynomial mapping among :math:`(x,y)` coordinates between the warped and ideal readouts:

:math:`x_{i}=\sum^{N}_{i=0}\sum^{N}_{j=0}K_{x}^{(i,j)}x_{o}^{(j)}y_{o}^{(i)}`

:math:`\underbrace{y_{i}}_\text{warped}=\sum^{N}_{i=0}\sum^{N}_{j=0}K_{y}^{(i,j)}\underbrace{x_{o}^{(j)}y_{o}^{(i)}}_\text{dewarped}`

Note which sides of the mapping represent the `warped' and `dewarped'
coordinates in this application, which may be opposite to what one may
expect intuitively, or from the IDL documentation on
polywarp. Let's see why we do it this way by plunging into
the functions called within the find_dewarp_solution.py script.
      
match_pinholes.match_pinholes()
^^^^^^^^^

Within the template pipeline test_pipeline.py, you will see a call to
match_pinholes.match_pinholes(). This overlays a model coordinate grid
over the image that you need to try to match by tweaking the rotation,
offset, and barrel settings. You may have to run through a couple
times until you get a good match. The match doesn't have to
be exact; we're just making a grid so that the code recognizes which
empirical point sources it detects can be matched with model points

Once thatâ€™s done, run the script again so that it runs past the
function make_dewarp_coords(). This finds the aforementioned
coefficients by solving a least-squares problem via Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse matrices.

Here is an example of a matching that left some aliasing in the form
of a crescent. If you see aliasing like this, tweak the parameters and
try again:

.. _label:
.. figure:: images/kinks2.png
	   :scale: 90 %
           :align: center
	   :alt: Alternative text

You should end up with something that looks roughly like this:

.. _label:
.. figure:: images/matching_grids.pdf
	   :scale: 90 %
           :align: center
	   :alt: Alternative text

find_dewarp_solution.find_dewarp()
^^^^^^^^^

This next function takes the raw image, pastes the warped coordinates onto it, and then smooths everything out by resampling the image point-by-point over the entire image space, interpolating as needed when the coordinates are not at integer values (Fig. 4).
As a check, closely compare the pinhole grid images before and after (Fig. 5).

(Fig. 4 in procedure)

The last part of the script makes a lovely barb plot, putting evenly-spaced vectors over the array to show the directions that points on the readouts have to be stretched in order to dewarp it (Fig. 6).
