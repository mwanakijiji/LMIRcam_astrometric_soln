Installation
=================
At the moment, if you have Python 3.5 and standard astropy packages,
you can clone the code via

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/mwanakijiji/dewarp.git

Options with pip install and container files will be available in the
near future. I recommend creating a new environment on your system
(with Conda, for example) so that you can seal off this software's dependencies
from the rest of your system. Once you have done so, activate the new
environment, download this :download:`requirements.txt <files/requirements.txt>`
and install the packages with

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -r requirements.txt
