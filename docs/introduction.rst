Introduction
=================
This software is for dewarping the illumination beam on a detector based on a known 'perfect' distribution of point source, and also for finding the rotation solution of the dewarped frames based on the known positions of stellar objects.

This online documentation is restricted to the application of the calibration. See paper [...] for details about how the calibration was made, and for further scientific information.
