Introduction
=================
This software is for dewarping the illumination beam on a detector
based on a known 'perfect' distribution of point source, and also for
finding the rotation solution of the dewarped frames based on the
known positions of stellar objects.

We want to find the polynomial coefficients that map between empirical
pinhole locations and an idealized grid, namely

(eqns. 1 and 2 in procedure)
